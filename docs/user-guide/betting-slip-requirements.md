# Betting Slip Image Requirements

## Image Quality Guidelines

To ensure optimal OCR accuracy and betting slip analysis, follow these comprehensive guidelines for image capture and quality.

## Optimal Image Characteristics

### Technical Requirements

**Resolution**:
- **Minimum**: 800x600 pixels
- **Recommended**: 1920x1080 pixels or higher
- **Maximum**: 4000x4000 pixels

**File Format**:
- **Primary**: JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) - best compression balance
- **Alternative**: PNG (.png) - highest quality, larger files
- **Supported**: WebP, GIF (static), BMP
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB

**Image Quality Settings**:
- **Compression**: Use high quality JPEG settings (90%+ quality)
- **Color Mode**: RGB color preferred over grayscale
- **Bit Depth**: 24-bit color minimum

### Physical Setup Requirements

**Lighting Conditions**:
- **Natural Light**: Daylight or bright indoor lighting preferred
- **Even Illumination**: Avoid harsh shadows or bright spots
- **No Glare**: Eliminate reflections from paper or plastic surfaces
- **Color Temperature**: Neutral white light (5000K-6500K) optimal

**Camera Positioning**:
- **Distance**: 6-12 inches from betting slip
- **Angle**: Perpendicular to slip surface (90-degree angle)
- **Stability**: Use steady hands or tripod to avoid motion blur
- **Coverage**: Entire betting slip visible within frame boundaries

## Image Capture Best Practices

### ✅ Recommended Techniques

**1. Proper Surface Preparation**
```
• Flatten betting slip completely
• Remove wrinkles, folds, or creases
• Clean surface of dust or debris
• Use contrasting background (dark slip on light surface)
```

**2. Optimal Lighting Setup**
```
• Use multiple light sources to eliminate shadows
• Position lights at 45-degree angles from document
• Avoid direct flash - use indirect or diffused lighting
• Ensure even illumination across entire slip
```

**3. Camera Settings and Positioning**
```
• Use highest available resolution setting
• Enable image stabilization if available
• Focus on center of betting slip text
• Fill frame with betting slip (minimize background)
```

**4. Multiple Shot Strategy**
```
• Take 2-3 images from slightly different angles
• Include one close-up of critical information
• Capture backup shot with different lighting
• Review images before submitting best one
```

### ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Poor Lighting**:
- Using flash directly on reflective surfaces
- Photographing in dim or uneven lighting
- Creating shadows with poor light placement
- Mixed lighting conditions (natural + artificial)

**Camera Issues**:
- Motion blur from camera shake
- Out-of-focus images
- Tilted or skewed perspective
- Insufficient resolution or over-compression

**Physical Problems**:
- Folded or wrinkled betting slips
- Partially obscured text
- Dirty or damaged slip surfaces
- Cluttered backgrounds interfering with text

## Betting Slip Format Compatibility

### Supported Bookmaker Formats

The OCR system is optimized for these major bookmaker layouts:

**UK Bookmakers**:
- **Bet365**: Standard accumulator and single bet formats
- **William Hill**: Traditional and mobile app screenshots
- **Ladbrokes**: Physical slips and digital formats
- **Paddy Power**: Standard format betting slips
- **Sky Bet**: Mobile app and web platform formats
- **Coral**: Physical and digital betting slip formats

**Format Characteristics**:
- Clear team name presentation
- Decimal odds format (e.g., 1.28, 2.50)
- Standard market descriptions ("Full Time Result", "Both Teams To Score")
- Consistent layout with bet reference numbers
- Date and time information clearly displayed

### Text Layout Requirements

**Essential Elements**:
```
✓ Team names clearly visible and unambiguous
✓ Decimal odds in standard format (X.XX)
✓ Market types explicitly stated
✓ Fixture information (Team A v Team B format)
✓ Bet reference numbers for verification
✓ Stake and return amounts clearly displayed
✓ Date information for match identification
```

**Text Characteristics**:
- **Font Size**: Minimum 8pt equivalent for reliable recognition
- **Font Type**: Standard sans-serif fonts work best
- **Contrast**: High contrast between text and background
- **Spacing**: Adequate spacing between different selections
- **Alignment**: Consistent alignment and formatting

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Mobile Phone Photography

**Camera App Settings**:
- Enable grid lines for better composition
- Use tap-to-focus on betting slip text
- Disable digital zoom (move physically closer instead)
- Use HDR mode for challenging lighting conditions

**Holding Technique**:
- Use both hands for maximum stability
- Brace elbows against body or surface
- Take multiple shots with slight variations
- Review images immediately after capture

**Common Mobile Issues**:
- Auto-focus hunting in low light
- Over-aggressive image compression
- Screen reflections when photographing digital slips
- Insufficient resolution from older devices

### Desktop/Laptop Camera

**Webcam Considerations**:
- External webcam typically better than built-in
- Ensure camera is clean and unobstructed
- Use proper lighting setup as webcams are light-sensitive
- Consider using camera software with manual controls

**Screen Capture Method** (for digital slips):
- Use high-resolution screenshot tools
- Capture full betting slip area
- Save in uncompressed format (PNG preferred)
- Ensure text is rendered clearly on screen

## Troubleshooting Image Issues

### Poor OCR Results

**Symptoms**: Low confidence scores, incorrect text extraction

**Solutions**:
1. **Improve Lighting**: Use brighter, more even illumination
2. **Increase Resolution**: Take higher resolution photo
3. **Reduce Compression**: Use PNG format or high-quality JPEG
4. **Fix Focus**: Ensure sharp focus on text areas
5. **Flatten Document**: Remove wrinkles and folds completely

### Incomplete Data Extraction

**Symptoms**: Missing selections, incomplete odds information

**Solutions**:
1. **Full Coverage**: Ensure entire slip is visible in frame
2. **Proper Spacing**: Don't crop too tightly around edges
3. **Clear Separators**: Make sure selection boundaries are visible
4. **Complete Context**: Include bet type and market information

### Incorrect Team Recognition

**Symptoms**: Wrong team names, unrecognized selections

**Solutions**:
1. **Standard Formats**: Use betting slips from major bookmakers
2. **Clear Typography**: Ensure team names are in standard fonts
3. **Full Names**: Prefer full team names over abbreviations
4. **Context Clues**: Include fixture format ("Team A v Team B")

## Image Examples

### Excellent Quality Example
```
Characteristics of a perfect betting slip image:
• High resolution (1920x1080+)
• Even, natural lighting
• Sharp focus on all text
• Full betting slip coverage
• High contrast
• No reflections or shadows
• Standard bookmaker format
• All text clearly readable
```

### Poor Quality Example
```
Common issues that reduce accuracy:
• Low resolution (below 800x600)
• Uneven lighting with shadows
• Motion blur or out-of-focus areas
• Partial coverage missing edges
• Poor contrast
• Reflections or glare
• Non-standard or handwritten format
• Text too small to read clearly
```

## Advanced Tips for Challenging Situations

### Reflective Surfaces

**Problem**: Betting slips covered in plastic or laminated
**Solutions**:
- Position lights at 45-degree angles to minimize reflections
- Use polarizing filter if available
- Photograph at slight angle (15-20 degrees) to avoid direct reflection
- Use diffused lighting sources instead of direct illumination

### Small Text

**Problem**: Fine print or compressed betting slip layouts
**Solutions**:
- Move camera closer to increase effective resolution
- Use macro/close-up mode if available
- Take multiple images focusing on different sections
- Ensure maximum camera resolution setting is enabled

### Multiple Pages

**Problem**: Betting slip information spread across multiple pages
**Solutions**:
- Photograph each page separately with same quality standards
- Submit images in sequence (page 1, page 2, etc.)
- Ensure consistent lighting and quality across all pages
- Include page numbers or references for context

Following these guidelines will significantly improve OCR accuracy and ensure comprehensive betting slip analysis.
